# fxBuzzly

Buzzly.art embeds do not work in Discord, this fixes them. Replace `https://buzzly.art/` with `https://fxbuzzly.herokuapp.com/` to see an embed.

Inspired by [TwitFix](https://github.com/robinuniverse/TwitFix) and [fxdeviantart](https://github.com/robinuniverse/fxdeviantart) by [Robin](https://github.com/robinuniverse), whose code I stole and modified from as well.
