# fxBuzzly

Buzzly.art links do not embed in Discord, this fixes them (rudimentarily). Just add `fx` before the `buzzly.art` to see an embed.

> **NOTE**: fxBuzzly will **NOT** embed NSFW submissions or users who have set their posts to be unviewable by guests. We are also **NOT** affiliated with Buzzly.art.

Inspired by [TwitFix](https://github.com/robinuniverse/TwitFix) and [fxdeviantart](https://github.com/robinuniverse/fxdeviantart) by [Robin](https://github.com/robinuniverse), whose code I stole and modified from as well. She also gifted me the `fxbuzzly.art` domain, thanks a lot Robin!
